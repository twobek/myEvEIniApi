-- DOCKER

to build the containers in my project i use the following command

docker-compose up --build

to shut the server down

docker-compose down

to start only the the docker container with the db inside

docker-compose up -d db

to add new stuff to the container you have to delete the volumes to or the db is not getting initialised
think of this when there are changes made to the db when a new version is deployed to delete the volumes too

docker-compose down --volume

to run the unittests on the docker container just open another session und connect to the container

docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

the container_id can be retrieved by typing in docker ps
